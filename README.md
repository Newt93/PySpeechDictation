# PySpeechDictation
A simple speech recognition program that runs on command line

This code uses the SpeechRecognition library to create a recognizer object, which is used to listen to the microphone and recognize speech. The listen() method is used to listen to the microphone, and the recognize_google() method is used to recognize the speech and return the text.

To type the text on a textbox or any window, you can use a GUI library like Tkinter to create a textbox and use the insert() method to insert the recognized text.
